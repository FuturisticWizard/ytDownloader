To run your YouTube downloader script from the Windows command prompt using a custom command like ytd, you can follow these steps:

Create a Batch File:

Open a text editor (such as Notepad) and create a new file.
Paste the following content into the file:

@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
call venv\Scripts\activate
python ytDownloader2.py %*


Save the file with a .bat extension, for example, ytd.bat. Place this batch file in the same directory as your ytDownloader.py script.
Update System Environment Variables:

Add the directory containing your batch file to the system's PATH environment variable:
Right-click on the Start menu and select "System."
Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left.
In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
Under the "System variables" section, find the Path variable, select it, and click "Edit."
Click "New" and add the full path to the directory containing your batch file.
Also add full path to /venv/ folder within project.

Restart the Command Prompt:

Close and reopen the command prompt to ensure that it recognizes the changes to the PATH variable.
Now, you should be able to run your script using the custom command ytd:

ytd "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk&t=54s&ab_channel=DappUniversity"


This assumes that your virtual environment is located in a subdirectory named venv relative to your script. Adjust the paths accordingly if your setup is different.
